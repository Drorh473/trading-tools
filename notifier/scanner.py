"""Main scanning loop: pulls closed bars for each watchlist symbol, runs the
active strategies, and — on a fresh signal — sizes the position and dispatches
an Approve/Reject alert to Telegram.

Scans are aligned to candle closes rather than run on a fixed interval:
strategies evaluate closed candles, so between one close and the next the data
is identical and re-scanning only burns API quota. Each strategy declares the
timeframe(s) it needs; the scanner fetches the union of all of them and scans
at the cadence of the shortest one, so a strategy needing 1H+15m confluence
runs alongside a 1H-only strategy without special-casing either.

Approval doesn't log the trade immediately — it waits to see a matching
position actually appear on Bitget (execution.tracker.wait_for_signal_position),
the same account-based detection the `/add` flow and the future auto-execution
phase use. If none appears within the timeout the row is cancelled, which also
frees the symbol for future signals.
